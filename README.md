## What's Here

* **examples** - This folder contains examples discussed in the lessons.
* **lessons** - This folder contains the lessons in the course.
* **exercises** - This folder contains exercises to be completed during the course.
* **solutions** - This folder contains the solutions to the exercises within the exercise folder

## How to Follow the Course

There are a number of ways to work through the course:

### Lesson Based (recommended)

Read through the lessons, completing each exercise at the recommended point.

### Examples Based

Look through the examples and where necessary read the lesson to clarify any
example that doesn't make sense.
This approach may be good for those with programming experience in another
language, or a basic understanding of programming concepts.

### Exercise Based

Just work through the exercises and uses the examples or lessons where necessary
to fill gaps in understanding.
This may be appropriate as a refresher for those who already know python.

## A Note on Solutions

Solutions are provided for the exercises within the course, but it is best to
only consult the solution after completing the exercise to compare them or as
a very last resort if stuck on an exercise.
It's temping to copy the solution or look at it for answers but just keep in
mind:
