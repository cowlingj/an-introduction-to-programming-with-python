# absent_children.py

# first we need to open the name file so we know what the names of the children
# are

# create or append to a file the names of absent children
# we need to read from this file later

# create a variable to store the cursors starting position

# ask the user for todays date

# for every name in the list of names ask whether that chils is present

# if not add an entry to the absent file with the date

# close the name file now we're done with it

# go back to the starting position

# tell the user we are about to print all new entries

# print all new entries

# close the absent file since we're done
