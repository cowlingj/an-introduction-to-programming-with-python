"""
Greeter.py - Will build a list of names and then greet them all at once
"""

# we need an empty list of people to greet

# we also need a boolean to control if we need to add more names

# loop while we still want names

  # prompt for another name for us to add to the list of people to greet

  # prompt to ask whether or not to continue adding names

  # depending on if the user wants to add more we may change our variable

# do the actual greeting, we can print a list of strings directly,
# like we would print any other non string type with str(LIST_NAME)
