# stopwatch.py

# we use the time and date time modules from the standard library
# time let's us work out the time something happens
# datetime let's us express it in a readable form

# here we are just using input to make the program wait until
# the user is ready

# now the user is ready, we can set the start time

# we again take advantage of the fact input will make the
# program wait

# now we get the stop time

# stop time - start time = time elapsed, all we need to do
# is format it nicely

# lets print out our results
