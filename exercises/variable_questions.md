# Variable Questions

Lesson 2 covered quite a lot of information, here are some questions to test
your understanding - no cheating.

1. What does an __assigment statement__ do?
2. What is a __String__?
3. What data type is 2.718?
4. What is the difference between 4 and 4.0?
5. Consider the following:
```python
my_name="monty"
print("my_name")
```
The program should print "monty", but instead prints "my_name", why is this?
