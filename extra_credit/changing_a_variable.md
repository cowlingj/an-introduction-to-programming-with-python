## Changing a Variable

When we work with variables in python, really we are just working with a set
of names for things, almost like a set of labels; just like labels, we can
remove a name from one thing and give it to something else.

```python3
default_dog_name = "Bob"
dog_name = defaulft_dog_name

user_dog_name = input("What is a good name for a dog? ")
dog_name = user_dog_name
```

> This re-assignment can be really useful, but if we're not careful we can
> reassign things without realising
