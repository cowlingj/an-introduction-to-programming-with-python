## Using REPL.it

REPL.it is a free online tool which allows us to write and test code in a
browser without having to install anything on our computer.
It can be used as a quick way to demonstrate code, or to observe pieces of a
program.

> There are alternatives to REPL.it, such as [ideone.com](http://www.ideone.com)

REPL.it is more limited than an installed version of python, but it means that
we can get started on any machine, and it won't make a difference since we will
all be faced with the exact same thing - rather than worry about differences
between Windows, Mac, and Linux.

An account can be made with REPL.it by clicking login in the very top right, or
by creating an account using the window which appears if the site detects a new
user. Click sign up in the top right of the opened window and then enter the
details required, alternatively sign up with social media accounts, such as
Facebook or Google.

> For those with a little more experience:
> REPL.it loads the code into an interpreter, so we can't access command line
> arguments, we can still access standard in as normal, so just keep this in
> mind
