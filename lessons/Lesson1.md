## Hello World

A hello world program is considered one of the easiest programs to write, and a
great place to start for any language to make sure that everything is set up
properly.

The purpose of hello world is to just print out the words "hello world"; because
this program is usually quite easy it means we can check things are good to go
quickly and easily.

## print

The print function is a function built into python which will take some text,
otherwise known as a **string** and print it to the output or **standard out**.
Below is a demonstration of the print function.

```python
print("I have taken the first steps in programming")
```

Notice the brackets and quotes around what we want to print out.
