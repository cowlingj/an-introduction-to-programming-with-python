# Lesson 13

## Wrapping things up

So This course is comming to an end, lets look at what we have learned.

So we started with hello world, then looked at variables and data types, as
well as user input.
later we used mathematical operations, conditional expressions, loops and
arrays.
We finished up with functions and modules.

## Where to Next

Okay so that's what we've done, where to next?
First of all, if you haven't looked at much of the examples or exercises, give
them a try; if you have some of the following things may be of intrest.

**Want to learn more advanced things?**  
Take a look at
[object oriented programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm);
a very well used programming paradigm that even for a course as simple as this,
we've been exposed to in order to do some of the things we have.

**Want to write graphical pragrams you can show off?**  
Try the [curses module](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html)
or [PyQt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt),
both of these modules are used to
make graphical user interfaces (or GUIs), with curses being used
for terminal style GUIs and PyQt being for window style GUIs.

> You may have trouble using REPL.it with these modules.

**Like python? Go ahead and install it?**  
Python can be installed on all major opperating systems, comming
either as just the simple interpreter like we've been working with,
or with more tools to make programming quicker and easier (get it from the
[offical python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

**Want a challenge?**  
There is one more exercise, and one more example, they use
most of the concepts we have discussed in the course - have a look at
[employee_tracker](../examples/employee_tracker.py),
and create a game of [snakes and ladders](../exercises/snakes_and_ladders.py).

**Want to help others?**  
show them this course, or even contribute to this course
with examples exercises, lessons, or extra credit.

**Perhaps you're curious as to how this course was created, or just want to
learn another really cool tool, that can help both in and outside of
programming**
If that's the case take a look at version control, I've used
[git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
to make this course, with GitHub but there are other version control
systems out there, and they all could save a lot of pain -
especially when working on bigger projects.

**Want more Practice?**
There are plenty of places where you can play around with programming and try
even more examples, just one example is [code wars](https://www.codewars.com/)
a website where you can take on challenges in python or many other languages
of choice.

**Interested in the world of programming?**  
There's plenty more than python,
there are many programming languages such as java, ruby, go, and C++, or
you could even learn some web development, starting with html and css
[(w3schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/) may be useful here.

**Perhaps this isn't for you**  
In that case then I hope you enjoyed your little
peak into the world that is programming, and hopefully youv'e gained something
useful from this course.

## Feedback
If you can leave any feedback to help me improve the course, that
would be much appreciated.

## Learn Through Doing
If you do choose to continue this journey, then make sure to focus on practice,
practice is the key to programming, there's no shame in needing to look things
up, even professionals forget things and need to refer to documentation, and
even professionals keep learning; that's a truth you may come accross quite
often - in Programming you **never** stop learning.

So keep on learning, and best of luck; from these humble beggings you could go
on to create something huge.
